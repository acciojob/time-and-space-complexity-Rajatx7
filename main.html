	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.An algorithm with efficient time complexity typically has a rate of growth that is as small as possible relative to the size of the input.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> in programming refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm needs to solve a problem based on the size of the input. Using the notation O(n) in space complexity means that the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
